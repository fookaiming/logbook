# Overview

## Common Problem when developing concurrent programme
1. starvation
   - prevent starvation by placing a timeout, waits for only a finite amount of time
2. deadlock
   - prevent deadlock by acquiring resources in a specific order
   - ***better avoid explicit locks and sharing mutable state***
3. ***race condition*** *(**should be eliminated at root**)*
   - two main factors lead to race condition
     1. JIT optimization
     2. Java Memory Model

## Shared mutability is pure evil
> When we have a nonfinal (mutable) field, each time a thread changes the value, we have to consider whether we have to put the change back to the memory or leave it in the registers/cache. Each time we read the field, we need to be concerned if we read the latest valid value or a stale value left behind in the cache. We need to ensure the changes to variables are atomic; that is, threads donâ€™t see partial changes. Furthermore, we need to worry about protecting multiple threads from changing the data at the same time. Every single access to shared mutable state must be verified to be correct. Even if one of them is broken, the entire application is broken.

### ways to prevent shared mutability
- keep the mutable state well encapsulated and share only immutable data
- functional programming
- use library that will watch over the changes and warn us of any violations
